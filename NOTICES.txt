below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that 
is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,

shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by 
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original 
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for

Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes 
of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or 
written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or 
Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this 
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, 
and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those 
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent 
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of 
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in 
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of 
this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the 
Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the 
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the 
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the 
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along 
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that 
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a 
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the 
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required 
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and 
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in 
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in 
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in 
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree 
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
